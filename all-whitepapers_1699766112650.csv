**Abstract.** A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

## 1. Introduction

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"

What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

## 2. Transactions

We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
5,5c4adcba-70e4-4c62-afbe-15373dd259b5,"

The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
6,6ab463a7-3d45-4b8a-b8da-c11fd11977bc,"

We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [^1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.

## 3. Timestamp Server

The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
8,e07b8855-e98d-4517-9387-c7f51c132e6b,"

## 4. Proof-of-Work

To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [^6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
9,7bbc2d3d-5525-4075-86e4-9ad32d440b3a,"

For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
10,5d457d9b-4e3c-4360-8635-207b81d3724f,"

The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
11,aba25301-6edd-46e8-aa8b-d6e08cb36f0d,"

To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
12,49380926-a05e-4492-aa88-1848de789a3b,"

## 5. Network

The steps to run the network are as follows:

1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
13,54e32c60-15d1-4b2b-aece-223c0594dd5b,"

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
14,b8d7e5c0-d5d8-4b4c-93ac-2012b7c7100c,"

New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
15,ccdb488c-1df3-4641-a058-0a5d67199a31,"

## 6. Incentive

By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
16,09784fdc-cb23-4c9e-bb82-e893eab68cfa,"

The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
17,19b13b83-eab4-43d1-a960-797242e8def2,"

The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
18,36125304-253a-4318-ac0f-a2c5c3bbae80,"

## 7. Reclaiming Disk Space

Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [^7] [^2] [^5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
19,825163e3-7219-4abd-8487-c1af67fbc983,"

A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
20,2cb1e488-66b7-4125-947f-538d80dc58df,"

## 8. Simplified Payment Verification

It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
21,c860e59e-d0a1-4d25-b830-d8a149e8715c,"



","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
22,53786c15-1c0b-4019-894b-691ad5e7a84b,"

As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
23,53c51c4a-6630-4988-b1dc-90a357431d11,"

## 9. Combining and Splitting Value

Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
24,578730ab-68fa-45eb-8356-d4f94e7c976e,"

It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
25,00681efd-7091-4c85-ac9e-f8ee926a972f,"

## 10. Privacy

The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
26,d2860ccb-8683-4f4e-bed0-a4fb6c81ceef,"

As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
27,9e31e4ee-0bee-4565-8d79-a626c7b0f2bf,"

## 11. Calculations
We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
28,f460f30b-215f-4742-8e07-e6ad51519825,"

The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
29,ebf00f26-0e24-4a48-baed-45123e1fdc14,"

The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [^8]:

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
30,380939d6-0890-45e8-be68-1519cdb9c1fa,"
$$
qz = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } p \leq q \\
\left(\frac{q}{p}\right) z & \text{if } p > q 
\end{cases}
$$

Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind. 

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
31,66378bd9-59a1-420e-ad0d-ade033e9d634,"

We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
32,9cfaf4c6-d4c6-4dd3-a6de-0ace40d43cb9,"

The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
33,70f6c1b8-c2a5-4e2a-a5c7-5b19cb207ade,"

The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:

$$
\lambda = z\frac{q}{p}
$$

","{""file_name"":""bitcoin-whitepaper.md""}"
34,b8e7bd12-e69f-46df-9a02-99fa88b42a1b,"

To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot \left\{ 
\begin{array}{cl} 
\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{(z-k)} & \text{if } k \leq z \\

## 12. Conclusion

We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

## Abstract

The rise of blockchains as a new Internet infrastructure has led to developers deploying tens of thousands of decentralized applications at rapidly growing rates. Unfortunately, blockchain usage is not yet ubiquitous due to frequent outages, high costs, low throughput limits, and numerous security concerns. To enable mass adoption in the web3 era, blockchain infrastructure needs to follow the path of cloud infrastructure as a trusted, scalable, cost-efficient, and continually improving platform for building widely-used applications.

","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
40,ac728755-24b8-467f-b3a4-7ce3e5cd6011," 

We present the *Aptos blockchain*, designed with scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability as key principles, to address these challenges. The Aptos blockchain has been developed over the past three years by over 350+ developers across the globe [1]. It offers new and novel innovations in consensus, smart contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. The combination of these technologies will provide a fundamental building block to bring web3 to the masses:

","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
41,9130350a-5ecc-4fd7-9560-f3f13876f97a," 

* First, the Aptos blockchain natively integrates and internally uses the *Move language* for fast and secure transaction execution [2]. The *Move prover*, a formal verifier for smart contracts written in the Move language, provides additional safeguards for contract invariants and behavior. This focus on security allows developers to better protect their software from malicious entities.

42,31139170-6d65-4242-a07b-23e4170a9fd7," 

* Second, the Aptos data model enables flexible key management and hybrid custodial options. This, alongside transaction transparency prior to signing and practical light client protocols, provides a safer and more trustworthy user experience.

","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
43,dfcce965-4875-4f03-b2f7-8b075ac68f12," 

* Third, to achieve high throughput and low latency, the Aptos blockchain leverages a pipelined and modular approach for the key stages of transaction processing. Specifically, transaction dissemination, block metadata ordering, parallel transaction execution, batch storage, and ledger certification all operate concurrently. This approach fully leverages all available physical resources, improves hardware efficiency, and enables highly parallel execution.

","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
44,1181b10d-b9c7-4788-bad9-ff7422a54fd2," 

* Fourth, unlike other parallel execution engines that break transaction atomicity by requiring upfront knowledge of the data to be read and written, the Aptos blockchain does not put such limitations on developers. It can efficiently support atomicity with arbitrarily complex transactions, enabling higher throughput and lower latency for real-world applications and simplifying development.

45,540e8d81-f4cf-4438-aa4c-9736c04e1775,"

* Finally, the Aptos blockchain is experimenting with future initiatives to scale beyond individual validator performance: its modular design and parallel execution engine support internal sharding of a validator and homogeneous state sharding provides the potential for horizontal throughput scalability without adding additional complexity for node operators.

## 1 Introduction
In the web2 version of the Internet, services such as messaging, social media, finance, gaming, shop- ping, and audio/video streaming, are provided by centralized companies that control direct access to user data (e.g., Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta). These companies develop infrastructure using application-specific software optimized for targeted use cases and leverage cloud infrastructures to de- ploy these applications to users. Cloud infrastructure provides access to virtualized and/or physical infrastructure services, such as rented virtual machines (VMs) and bare metal hardware operating inside data centers worldwide (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). As a result, building web2 Internet services that can scale to billions of users has never been easier than it is today. However, web2 requires that users place explicit trust in centralized entities, a requirement that has become increasingly concerning to society.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
48,79c6684f-328f-4e4d-ad1b-b89c5a412466,"

To combat this concern, a new Internet age has begun: web3. In the web3 version of the Internet, blockchains have emerged to provide decentralized, immutable ledgers that enable users to interact with one another securely and reliably, all without requiring trust in controlling intermediaries or centralized entities. Similar to how web2 Internet services and applications rely on cloud infrastructure as building blocks, decentralized applications can use blockchains as a decentralized infrastructure layer to reach billions of users across the world.

However, despite the existence of many blockchains today, widespread adoption of web3 has not yet taken place [3]. While technology continues to advance the industry, existing blockchains are unreliable, impose high transaction fees for users, have low throughput limitations, suffer regular asset losses due to security issues, and cannot support real-time responsiveness. In comparison to how cloud infrastructure has enabled web2 services to reach billions, blockchains have not yet enabled web3 applications to do the same.

We envision a decentralized, secure, and scalable network governed and operated by the community that uses it. When infrastructure demands grow across the world, the computational resources of the blockchain scale up horizontally and vertically to meet those needs. As new use cases and technological advances arise, the network should frequently and seamlessly upgrade without interrupting users. Infrastructure concerns should fade into the background. Developers and users will have access to many different options for key recovery, data modeling, smart contract standards, resource usage trade- offs, privacy, and composability. Users know that their assets are secure, always available, and can be accessed with near at-cost fees. Anyone can safely, easily, and immutably transact with untrusted parties worldwide. Blockchains are as ubiquitous as cloud infrastructure.

To achieve this vision, significant technological advances must be made. Our experiences building, developing, advancing, and deploying the Diem blockchain (the predecessor of the Aptos blockchain) over the past three years have proven that a network can continually upgrade its protocols without disrupting its clients [4]. The Diem mainnet was deployed to more than a dozen node operators with multiple wallet providers in early 2020. Over the following year, our team issued two major upgrades that changed the consensus protocol and the core framework. Both upgrades completed without downtime for users. With the Aptos blockchain, we have made a series of radical improvements to the technology stack while also incorporating safe, transparent, and frequent upgrades as a core feature, as inspired by the Diem blockchain. In particular, we highlight novel methods of transaction processing (as described in Section 7) and new approaches to decentralization and network governance.

## 3 Overview
The Aptos blockchain, as shown in Figure 1, is comprised of a set of validators that jointly receive and process transactions from users using a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT), proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Token holders lock up, or stake, tokens in their selected validators. Each validator’s consensus voting weight is proportionate to the amount staked into it. A validator can be active and participate in consensus. Likewise, a validator may also be inactive if it does not have enough stake to participate, rotates out of the validator set, elects to be offline as it synchronizes blockchain state, or is deemed not participating by the consensus protocol due to poor historical performance.

Clients are any part of the system that need to submit transactions or query the state and history of the blockchain. Clients can choose to download and verify validator signed proofs of queried data. Full nodes are clients that replicate the transaction and blockchain state from the validators or from other full nodes in the network. They may elect to prune transaction history and blockchain state as desired to reclaim storage. Light clients only maintain the current set of validators and can query partial blockchain state securely, typically from full nodes. Wallets are a common example of a light client.

To meet the needs of safe, fast, reliable, and upgradeable web3 infrastructure for widespread adop- tion, the Aptos blockchain is built on the following core design principles:
- Fast and secure execution along with simple auditability and mechanical analyzability via a new smart contract programming language, Move [5]. - Move originated with the predecessor to the Aptos blockchain and continues to progress with the evolution of this project.
- Extremely high throughput and low latency through a batched, pipelined, and parallelized ap- proach to transaction processing.
- Novel parallel transaction processing that efficiently supports atomicity with arbitrarily complex transactions through Block-STM, unlike existing parallel execution engines that require upfront knowledge of data locations to be read and written.
- Optimizations for performance and decentralization via rapid, stake-weight validator set rotation and reputation tracking.
- Upgradeability and configurability as first-class design principles to embrace new use cases and the latest technology.
- Modular designs that enable rigorous component level testing along with appropriate threat modeling and seamless deployment, all ensuring highly secure and reliable operations.
- Horizontal throughput scalability while preserving decentralization, where sharding is a first-class concept exposed to users and native to the programming and data model.

## 4 The Move language
Move is a new smart contract programming language with an emphasis on safety and flexibility. The Aptos blockchain uses Move’s object model to represent its ledger state (see Section 5.5) and uses Move code (modules) to encode rules of state transitions. Users submit transactions that can publish new modules, upgrade existing modules, execute entry functions defined within a module, or contain scripts that can directly interact with the public interfaces of modules.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
58,980de32a-8eff-402a-bee0-aa00358bd131,"

The Move ecosystem contains a compiler, a virtual machine, and many other developer tools. Move is inspired by the Rust programming language, which makes the ownership of data explicit in the language via concepts like linear types. Move emphasizes resource scarcity, preservation, and access control. Move modules define the lifetime, storage, and access pattern of every resource. This ensures that resources like Coin are not produced without appropriate credentials, cannot be double spent, and do not disappear.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
59,c300889f-0361-4df0-83b4-43edc19da4db,"

Move leverages a bytecode verifier to guarantee type and memory safety even in the presence of untrusted code. To help write more trusted code, Move includes a formal verifier, the Move Prover [6], capable of verifying the functional correctness of a Move program against a given specification, formulated in the specification language integrated into Move.

Beyond the user accounts and corresponding account content, the ledger state also contains the on-chain configuration of the Aptos blockchain. This network configuration includes the set of active validators, staking properties, and the configuration of various services within the Aptos blockchain. Move’s support for module upgradeability and comprehensive programmability enables seamless con- figuration changes and supports upgrades to the Aptos blockchain itself (both sets of upgrades have been executed multiple times with zero downtime on a private mainnet).

The Aptos team has further enhanced Move with support for broader web3 use cases. As mentioned later in Section 5.5, the Aptos blockchain enables fine-grained resource control. Not only does this support parallelization of execution, but it also achieves a near-fixed cost associated with accessing and mutating data. Moreover, the Aptos blockchain provides table support built on top of fine-grained storage, which allows for large-scale datasets (e.g., massive collections of NFTs) in a single account. Furthermore, Aptos supports shared or autonomous accounts that are represented entirely on-chain. This allows complex decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to collaboratively share accounts, as well as use these accounts as containers for a heterogeneous collection of resources.

## 5 Logical data model
The ledger state of the Aptos blockchain represents the state of all the accounts. The ledger state is versioned using an unsigned 64-bit integer corresponding to the number of transactions the system has executed. Anyone can submit a transaction to the Aptos blockchain to modify the ledger state. Upon execution of a transaction, a transaction output is generated. A transaction output contains zero or more operations to manipulate the ledger state (called write sets), a vector of resulting events (see Section 5.1.1), the amount of gas consumed, and the executed transaction status.

### 5.1 Transactions
A signed transaction contains the following information:
- Transaction authenticator: The sender uses a transaction authenticator that includes one or more digital signatures to verify that a transaction is authenticated.
- Sender address: The account address of the sender.
- Payload: The payload either refers to an existing entry function on-chain or contains the function to be executed as inlined bytecode (called a script). In addition, a set of input arguments is encoded in byte arrays. For a peer-to-peer transaction, the inputs contain the recipient’s information and the amount transferred to them.
- Gas price (in specified currency/gas units): This is the amount the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas to execute the transaction. Gas is a way to pay for compute, networking, and storage. A gas unit is an abstract measurement of computation with no inherent real-world value.
- Maximum gas amount: The maximum gas amount is the maximum gas units the transaction is allowed to consume prior to aborting. The account must have at least the gas price multiplied by the maximum gas amount or the transaction will be discarded during validation.
- Sequence number: The sequence number of the transaction. This must match the sequence number stored in the sender’s account when the transaction executes. Upon successful transac- tion execution, the account sequence number is incremented to prevent replay attacks.
- Expiration time: A timestamp after which the transaction ceases to be valid.
- Chain id: Identifies the blockchain that this transaction is valid for, offering further protection for users to prevent signing errors.
<!--  1. Ledger state\n2. Unsigned 64-bit integer\n3. Transaction submission\n4. Transaction output\n5. Write sets -->

At each version i, the state change is represented by the tuple (Ti,Oi,Si), containing the transaction, transaction output, and the resulting ledger state, respectively. Given a deterministic function Apply, the execution of transaction Ti with ledger state Si−1 produces the transaction output Oi and a new ledger state Si. That is, Apply(Si−1, Ti) → ⟨Oi, Si⟩.


#### 5.1.1 Events
Events are emitted during the execution of a transaction. Each Move module can define its own events and select when to emit these events upon execution. For example, during a coin transfer, both the sender and receiver’s accounts will emit SentEvent and ReceivedEvent, respectively. This data is stored within the ledger and can be queried via an Aptos node. Each registered event has a unique key and the key can be used to query event details.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
64,64f1ff11-3d21-4332-a7dd-69e48ef548ea,"


Multiple events emitted to the same event key produce event streams, a list of events with each entry containing a sequentially increasing number beginning at 0, a type, and data. Each event must be defined by some type. There may be multiple events defined by the same or similar types, especially when using generics. Events have associated data. For Move module developers, the general principle is to include all data necessary to understand the changes to the underlying resources before and after the execution of the transaction that changed the data and emitted the event.

Transactions can only generate events and cannot read events. This design allows transaction execution to be a function only of the current state and transaction inputs, not historical information (e.g., previously generated events).

66,e465ebea-c984-4d12-b332-71acf285348f,"

### 5.2 Accounts
Each account is identified by a unique 256-bit value known as an account address. A new account is created in the ledger state (see Section 5.5) when a transaction sent from an existing account invokes the create_account(addr) Move function. This typically happens when a transaction attempts to send Aptos tokens to an account address that has not yet been created. For convenience, Aptos also supports a transfer(from, to, amount) function that implicitly creates an account if it does not already exist prior to the transfer.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
67,b42efa8f-dc1b-47fc-b3f6-9abac93be7a4,"



To create a new account, a user first generates a signature key-pair: (vk, sk). Next, the new account address for a given signature scheme is derived using the cryptographic hash H of the public verification key vk that is concatenated with the signature scheme identifier (ssid): where addr = H(vk, ssid).
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
68,983c6a10-d68b-4153-8e30-cf297334a042,"


After the new account is created at address addr, the user can sign transactions to be sent from the account at addr, using the private signing key sk. The user can also rotate sk, either to proactively change sk or to respond to a possible compromise. This will not change the account address, as the account address is derived only once, during its creation, from the public verification key.

69,2da6d44e-b7f1-40b1-b564-5d967a4e492f,"


The Aptos blockchain does not link accounts to a real-world identity. A user can create multiple accounts by generating multiple key-pairs. Accounts controlled by the same user have no inherent link to each other. However, a single user can still manage multiple accounts in a single wallet for simple asset management. This flexibility provides pseudonymity for users while we experiment with privacy-preserving primitives for future releases. Multiple accounts owned by a single user or a set of users also provide channels to increase execution concurrency, as described in Section 7.4.

70,c1f33894-35b2-46e6-94db-7f7720106089,"


### 5.3 Move modules
A Move module contains Move bytecode that declares data types (structs) and procedures. It is identified by the address of the account where the module is declared along with a module name. For example, the identifier for the first currency module in Figure 2 is 0x1::coin. A module can depend on other on-chain modules, as shown by the wallet module in Figure 2, enabling code reuse.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
71,5d4e9686-c24f-43de-b2b0-00f4246a433f,"


A module must be uniquely named within an account, i.e., each account can declare at most one module with any given name. For example, the account at address 0x1 in Figure 2 could not declare another module named coin. On the other hand, the account at address 0x3 could declare a module named coin and the identifier of this module would be 0x3::coin. Note that 0x1::coin::Coin and 0x3::coin::Coin are distinct types and cannot be used interchangeably nor share common module code. In contrast, 0x1::coin::Coin<0x2::wallet::USD> and 0x1::coin::Coin<0x2::wallet::JPY> are different instantiations of the same generic type that cannot be used interchangeably but can share common module code.

72,f0182ba7-23e6-42cd-92e9-244360c62ac8,"


Modules are grouped into packages located at the same address. An owner of this address publishes the package as a whole on-chain, including the bytecode and package metadata. The package meta- data determines whether a package can be upgraded or is immutable. For an upgradeable package, compatibility checks are performed before the upgrade is permitted: no existing entry point functions must be changed and no resources can be stored in memory. However, new functions and resources can be added.

### 5.4 Resources
Similar to modules, account addresses can also have data values associated with them. Within each account address, the values are keyed by their types, with at most one value of each type belonging to the account. Figure 3 provides an example of this. Address 0x50 holds a single value, with 0x3::coin::Coin being the fully-qualified type. 0x3 is the address where the coin module is stored, coin is the name of the module and Coin is the name of the data type. Values of generic types are also allowed, with different instantiations being treated as distinct types. This is essential for extensibility, allowing different instantiations to share the same functional code.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
75,e4ef6bde-2fb8-4a20-9c76-4b84a79ad242,"


The rules for mutating, deleting, and publishing a value are encoded in the module that defines the data type. Move’s safety and verification rules prevent other code or entities from directly creating, modifying, or deleting instances of data types defined in other modules.
Having at most one top-level value of each type under an address may at first sound limiting. However, this is not a problem in practice as programmers can define wrapper types with other data as internal fields, thus avoiding any limitations. The Wallet struct in Figure 3 is an example of how to use wrapper types.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
76,4432d363-e86d-4dc5-9c6c-5e7588358e48,"


It should also be noted that not all data types can be stored on-chain. For data instances to qualify as top-level values, the data type must have the key ability. Similarly, the store ability is required for nested values. Data types with both abilities are also called resources.

77,550beaed-adea-45fc-8bca-bc5a262b3f4b,"


### 5.5 Ledger state
From the perspective of the Move virtual machine (Move VM), each account consists of a set of values and key-value data structures. These data structures are called table entries and are stored in the Binary Canonical Serialization format (BCS). This data layout enables developers to write smart contracts that can operate efficiently on small amounts of data replicated across a large number of accounts, as well as on large amounts of data stored in a small number of accounts. Move modules are stored similarly to account data but under an independent namespace. The genesis ledger state defines the initial set of accounts and their associated state at blockchain initialization.

At launch, the Aptos blockchain will be represented by a single ledger state. However, as adoption increases and technology develops, Aptos will scale up the number of shards to increase throughput (i.e., enable multiple ledger states) and support transactions that move or access assets across shards. Each ledger state will maintain all on-chain assets for the specific shard and provide the same account model with a fine-grained, <!-- 1. Ledger state\n2. On-chain assets\n3. Shard\n4.

## 6 A safe user experience
To reach billions of Internet users, the web3 user experience must be safe and accessible. In the sections below, we describe several innovations provided by the Aptos blockchain that work towards this goal.

### 6.1 Transaction viability protection
Signing a transaction means that the signer authorizes the transaction to be committed and executed by the blockchain. Occasionally, users may sign transactions unintentionally or without fully considering all the ways in which their transactions might be manipulated. To reduce this risk, the Aptos blockchain constrains the viability of every transaction and protects the signer from unbounded validity. There are currently three different protections provided by the Aptos blockchain - the sender’s sequence number, a transaction expiration time, and a designated chain identifier.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
80,0fd7d23a-9035-46c5-9248-908d79152ab4,"

- A transaction’s sequence number can only be committed exactly once for each sender’s account. As a result, senders can observe that if the current account sequence number is ≥ the sequence number of a transaction t, then either t has already been committed or t will never be committed (as the sequence number used by t has already been consumed by another transaction).
- The blockchain time advances with high precision and frequency (typically sub-second), as de- tailed in Section 7.3.1. If the blockchain time exceeds the expiration time of transaction t, then similarly, either t has already been committed or t will never be committed.
- Every transaction has a designated chain identifier to prevent malicious entities from replaying transactions between different blockchain environments (e.g., across a testnet and mainnet).
<!-- 1. Transaction\n2. Chain identifier\n3. Malicious entities\n4. Replaying transactions\n5. Testnet and mainnet-->


### 6.2 Move-based key management
As discussed in Section 5.2, Aptos accounts support key rotation, an important feature that can help reduce the risks associated with private key compromise, long-range attacks, and future advances that might break existing cryptographic algorithms. In addition, Aptos accounts are also flexible enough to enable new hybrid models of custody. In one such model, a user can delegate the ability to rotate the account’s private key to one or more custodians and other trusted entities. A Move module can then define a policy that empowers these trusted entities to rotate the key under specific circumstances. For example, the entities might be represented by a k-out-of-n multi-sig key held by many trusted parties and offer key recovery services to prevent user key loss (e.g., 20% of Bitcoin is currently locked up in unrecoverable accounts [7]).
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
81,cd16034c-3911-4ccb-947b-84fc73171010,"


Moreover, while many wallets support various key recovery schemes, such as backing up private keys to cloud infrastructure, multi-party computation, and social recovery, they are typically implemented without blockchain support (i.e., off-chain). As a result, each wallet needs to implement its own key management infrastructure and related operations become opaque to users. In contrast, supporting key management 
functionality at the Aptos blockchain layer provides full transparency of all key-related operations and makes it simpler to implement a wallet with rich key management.

82,0631a9f1-86b2-442a-afd8-77d96085fd39,"

### 6.3 Pre-signing transaction transparency
Today, wallets provide very little transparency about the transactions they sign. As a result, users are often easily tricked into signing malicious transactions that may steal funds and have devastating consequences. This is true even for blockchains that require enumerating all on-chain data accessed by each transaction. As a result, there are few user safeguards currently in place, making users vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
83,cc8e60fe-a453-4a8c-a1d2-95c780c56a14,"


To address this, the Aptos ecosystem provides services for transaction pre-execution: a precaution- ary measure that describes to users (in human-readable form) the outcomes of their transactions prior to signing. Pairing this with a known history of prior attacks and malicious smart contracts will help to reduce fraud. In addition, Aptos also enables wallets to dictate constraints on transactions during execution. Violating these constraints will result in the transactions being aborted, to further protect users from malicious applications or social engineering attacks.

### 6.4 Practical light client protocols
Relying solely on the TLS/SSL certificates of API providers to establish trust between blockchain clients and servers does not protect clients sufficiently. Even in the presence of valid certificates, wallets and clients have no guarantees as to the authenticity and integrity of the data being presented

to them. As a result, API providers may return incorrect or malicious blockchain data, deceiving third parties and performing double-spend attacks.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
85,1864d4b7-0377-41f9-bb18-a3dccd1e401a,"


To prevent this, Aptos provides state proofs and light client verification protocols that can be used by wallets and clients to verify the validity of data being presented by an untrusted third-party server. Moreover, by leveraging the timestamp-based state proofs in Section 7.6.2, light clients can always ensure tight bounds on the freshness of account state (e.g., within seconds) and only need to track changes in the network configuration (epoch changes) or use current trusted checkpoints (waypoints) to stay up-to-date [8]. By combining high-frequency timestamps and inexpensive state proofs, the Aptos blockchain provides increased security guarantees to clients.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
86,f0719ddf-9d55-4e0f-a342-40176ab9a26d,"


In addition, Aptos nodes also expose rich, high-performance storage interfaces that can be further fine-tuned to allow subscriptions to proofs targeting specific data and accounts on-chain. This can be leveraged by light clients to retain minimal verifiable data without the need to run a full node or process a substantial number of transactions.

## 7 Pipelining, batching, and parallel transaction processing
To maximize throughput, increase concurrency, and reduce engineering complexity, transaction pro- cessing on the Aptos blockchain is divided into separate stages. Each stage is completely independent and individually parallelizable, resembling modern, superscalar processor architectures. Not only does this provide significant performance benefits, but also enables the Aptos blockchain to offer new modes of validator-client interaction. For example:
- Clients can be notified when specific transactions have been included in a batch of persisted transactions. Persisted and valid transactions are highly likely to be committed imminently.
- Clients can be informed when a batch of persisted transactions has been ordered. Thus, to reduce the latency of determining the executed transaction outputs, clients can select to execute transactions locally rather than wait for the validators to complete execution remotely.
- Clients can elect to wait for certified transaction execution by the validators and perform state synchronization on the attested results (e.g., see section 8).
<!-- 1. Maximize throughput\n2. Increase concurrency\n3. Engineering complexity\n4. Aptos blockchain\n5. Superscalar processor architectures-->


The Aptos modular design aids development speed and supports faster release cycles, as changes can be targeted to individual modules, instead of a single monolithic architecture. Similarly, the modular design also provides a structured path to scaling validators beyond a single machine, providing access to additional compute, network, and storage resources. Figure 4 shows the transaction life cycle across the various processing stages.

### 7.1 Batch processing
Batch processing is an important efficiency optimization that is part of every phase of operation in the Aptos blockchain. Transactions are grouped into batches by each validator during transaction dissemination, and batches are combined into blocks during consensus. The execution, storage, and

ledger certification phases also work in batches to provide opportunities for reordering, reduction of operations (e.g., duplicate computation or signature verification), and parallel execution.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
89,5f30aab3-7ccb-43f6-9efe-afb5a81f332d,"


Grouping transactions into batches can induce small amounts of latency, for example, waiting 200 milliseconds to accumulate a batch of transactions before performing dissemination. However, batching is easily configurable with respect to a maximum waiting period and maximum batch size, enabling a decentralized network to automatically optimize across latency and efficiency. Batching also allows for efficient fee markets to prioritize transactions and avoid unintended denial-of-service (DoS) attacks from overzealous clients.

### 7.2 Continuous transaction dissemination
Following the primary insight of Narwhal & Tusk [9], transaction dissemination in the Aptos blockchain is decoupled from consensus. Validators continuously stream batches of transactions to each other, utilizing all available network resources concurrently. Each batch distributed by a validator v is persisted, and a signature on the batch digest is sent back to v. Following the consensus requirements defined in Section 7.3, any 2f + 1 stake weighted signatures on the batch digest form a proof of availability (PoAv). Such a proof guarantees that at least f + 1 stake weighted honest validators have stored the batch, and thus all honest validators will be able to retrieve it prior to execution.

Infinitely persisting batches of transactions can open a DoS attack vector by causing validators to run out of storage and crash. To prevent this, each batch of transactions has an associated timestamp. The timestamp on the batch allows efficient garbage collection at each validator. In addition, a separate per-validator quota mechanism is designed to protect validators from running out of space even in the most extreme circumstances, such as under potential byzantine attacks. Batches also have sizing constraints that are validated prior to agreement to persist to stable storage. Finally, several optimizations to de-duplicate and cache transactions reduce storage costs and ensure performant integration with the parallel execution engine.

### 7.3 Block metadata ordering
One common misconception is that consensus is slow and therefore the primary bottleneck for blockchain throughput and latency. One of the key innovations of the Aptos blockchain is to decouple non- agreement related tasks out of the consensus phase, such as transaction dissemination, transaction execution/storage, and ledger certification. By decoupling transaction dissemination from the consen- sus phase, ordering can occur with very low bandwidth (block metadata and proofs only), resulting in high transaction throughput and minimized latency.

Today, the Aptos blockchain leverages the latest iteration of DiemBFTv4 [10], an optimistically responsive BFT consensus protocol. Consensus in the common case only requires two network round trips (with round trip times typically less than 300 milliseconds worldwide) and dynamically adjusts to faulty validators through a leader reputation mechanism [11]. The on-chain leader reputation mechanism promotes validators that have successfully committed blocks in a window and demotes validators that are not participating. This novel mechanism significantly improves performance in decentralized environments, correspondingly provides infrastructure for appropriate incentives, and quickly minimizes the impact of failed validators on throughput and latency.
DiemBFTv4 guarantees liveness under partial synchrony and ensures safety under asynchrony where the total validator stake is ≥ 3f + 1 with up to f stake-weighted faulty validators. DiemBFTv4 has been extensively tested in several iterations since 2019 with dozens of node operators and a multi- wallet ecosystem. We are also experimenting with our recent research (e.g., Bullshark [12]) and other protocols that rely on the block history and associated communication to determine block metadata ordering and finality.

A consensus block and a proposal timestamp are proposed by a leader and agreed upon by the other validators as shown in Figure 5. Note that each consensus block contains only the batch metadata and proofs. Actual transactions are not required in the block, as the PoAV ensure that the batches of transactions will be available at the execution phase after ordering (see Section 7.2). Validators may vote on a leader’s proposal after verifying the proof and the block metadata criteria are met (e.g., proposal timestamp ≤ block expiration time).

#### 7.3.1 Blockchain time
The Aptos blockchain adopts an approximate, agreed-upon, physical timestamp for every proposed block, and correspondingly, all transactions within that block. This timestamp enables many important use cases. For example:
- Time-dependent logic in smart contracts. For instance, a developer would like to encode that all bids on an auction must be received prior to noon on Thursday.
- As oracles publish on-chain data, an accurate and trusted on-chain timestamp is required to correlate events and handle delays from real-world data.
- Clients can discern how up-to-date they are with respect to the blockchain. For security rea- sons, to avoid stale data and long-range attacks, a client should have access to a high-precision timestamp on when the account state was updated.
- Auditing the blockchain with a well-trusted timestamp provides a strong correlation to off-chain events, such as ensuring that legally-enforced payouts meet expected requirements.
- Transaction expiration is based on the most recent committed timestamp. As an additional safe- guard for client transactions, clients can select an expiration time for a transaction, as described in Section 6.1.
<!-- 1. Aptos blockchain timestamp\n2. Time-dependent logic\n3. On-chain data\n4. High-precision timestamp\n5. Transaction expiration-->


The Aptos blockchain provides the following guarantees with respect to timestamps for all transactions within a block:
- Time is monotonically increasing in the blockchain. That is, if block B1 < block B2, then B1.T ime < B2.T ime.
- If a block of transactions is agreed on with timestamp T , then at least f + 1 honest validators have decided that T is in the past. An honest validator will only vote on a block when its own clock ≥ timestamp T. See Section 7.2.
- If a block of transactions has a quorum of signatures in consensus with timestamp T, an honest validator will not serve such a block to other validators until its own clock ≥ timestamp T.
<!-- 1. Time guarantees\n2. Monotonically increasing\n3. Block timestamps\n4. Validator's own clock\n5. Updated on committed block-->


The most recent timestamp is updated on every committed block and used as the timestamp for all transactions in that block. When the network is synchronous, a block of transactions is committed ev- ery single network round trip and provides a fast updating and highly reliable clock. A finer granularity of ordering within blocks of transactions can be determined if desired.

### 7.4 Parallel transaction execution
Once consensus block metadata is ordered, transactions can be executed by any validator, full node, or client. At least 2f + 1 stake weighted validators have veritably persisted transactions for the proposed batches. Since transaction dissemination is continuous, additional honest validators will receive the transaction batches over time. If an honest validator has not received the transactions for the ordered batches by the time it reaches the execution stage, it can download them from the 2f +1 stake weighted validators, knowing that at least f + 1 stake weighted validators ( ≥ half of the stake weighted PoAV signers) are honest.

An important goal for any blockchain is to enable as much parallel execution as possible. The Aptos blockchain advances this direction forward from both the data model and the execution engine.

#### 7.4.1 Parallel data model
The Move data model natively supports global addressing of data and modules. Transactions that do not have overlapping conflicts in data and accounts can execute in parallel. Given the pipelined design used by the Aptos blockchain, reordering a group of transactions can reduce the number of conflicts, thereby improving concurrency.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
97,40f88bc5-3adf-4332-af74-712452da9ff8,"



Even when transactions modify the same set of on-chain values, much of the transaction execution process can still be parallelized. The Aptos blockchain introduces a new concept, delta writes, that describes a modification to account state rather than the modified account state (e.g., increment an integer rather than simply determine the final value). All of the transaction processing can be completed in parallel, and then delta writes are applied in the correct sequence for conflicting values to ensure deterministic results.

Over time, the Aptos blockchain will continue to enhance the data model in ways that improve concurrency (e.g., leverage read/write hints) and also improve ergonomics, making it more natural for developers to create, modify, and compose on-chain values. Move provides flexibility to make these improvements at both the language level and also through platform-specific functionality.

#### 7.4.2 Parallel execution engine
The Block-STM parallel execution engine detects and manages the conflicts for an ordered set of transactions along with optimistic concurrency control to allow for maximum parallelism given a particular ordering [13].
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
98,9419848e-e24b-4f87-ac4f-be3f762e253a,"


Batches of transactions are executed optimistically in parallel and validated post-execution. Un- successful validations lead to re-executions. Block-STM uses a multi-version data structure to avoid write-write conflicts. All writes to the same location are stored along with their versions, which contain their transaction IDs and the number of times the writing transaction was optimistically re-executed. When transaction tx reads a memory location, it obtains from the multi-version data structure the value written to this location by the highest transaction that appears before tx in the preset order, along with the associated version.

99,75df4435-caeb-4391-ba00-f3ea14dd96ea,"


Block-STM is already integrated into the Aptos blockchain. To understand the full potential of Block-STM performance, we ran experiments with non-trivial peer-to-peer Move transactions (i.e., 8 reads and 5 writes per transaction) as an isolated, execution-only (not end-to-end) benchmark with an in-memory database. In Figure 6, we presents our Block-STM execution results. Every block contains 10k transactions and the number of accounts determines the level of conflicts and contention.

Under low contention, Block-STM achieves 16x speedup over sequential execution with 32 threads, while under high contention, Block-STM achieves over 8x speedup. Unique to other parallel execution engines in the blockchain space, Block-STM is able to dynamically and transparently (without any hints from the user) extract the inherent parallelism from any workload. In comparison to parallel execution environments that require upfront knowledge of data locations to be read or written, Block- STM can support more complex transactions concurrently. This property leads to fewer yet more efficient transactions, decreases cost, and provides lower latency for users. Perhaps most importantly, splitting an atomic transaction into multiple, smaller transactions breaks the all-or-nothing semantics of a single transaction with complex state outcomes. Pairing expressive transaction semantics with parallel execution in Block-STM enables developers to have the best of both worlds.

Note that the block metadata ordering step does not preclude reordering transactions in the parallel execution phase. Transactions can be reordered across one or more blocks to optimize concurrency for parallel execution. The only requirement is that the reordering must be deterministic across all honest validators. Optimizing for parallel execution as well as adding randomization into the reordering can increase the performance and potentially discourage maximal extractable value (MEV) techniques for profitable validator transaction reordering. “Order-then-reveal” MEV resistant strategies can also be incorporated into this pipelined design.

### 7.5 Batch storage
The parallel execution phase results in write sets for all transactions in a group. These write sets can be stored in memory for maximum execution speed and then used as a cache for the next block or set of blocks to be executed. Any overlapping writes only need to be written to stable storage once. If a validator fails before storing the in-memory write sets, it can simply resume parallel execution from the block metadata ordering phase. Decoupling the batch storage of write sets from the parallel execution step ensures parallel execution can operate efficiently. In summary, batching write sets reduces the number of storage operations and takes advantage of more efficient, larger I/O operations.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
104,8c3ae0b4-3af5-477b-845a-b16337885a52,"


The amount of memory reserved for write set caching can be manually configured per machine and provides a natural back-pressure mechanism. The granularity of the batches can be different from the granularity of parallel execution blocks if desired to tune for specific I/O and memory environments.

### 7.6 Ledger certification
At this point in the pipeline, every individual validator has computed the new state for a committed block of transactions. However, to efficiently support verified light clients and state synchronization, the Aptos blockchain implements ledger certification for the ledger history as well as the ledger state. One key difference for the Aptos blockchain is that ledger certification is not on the critical path of transaction processing and can even be run completely out-of-band if desired.

#### 7.6.1 Ledger history certification
A validator appends the transactions together with their execution output to a global authenticated ledger data structure. Part of the transaction output is the state write set, consisting of the alterations made to the global state accessible by Move. The short authenticator of this data structure is a binding commitment to a ledger history, which includes the newly executed batch of transactions. Similar to transaction execution, the generation of this data structure is deterministic.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
106,d4f9c278-79b4-46ed-a772-1c0b222a5b1d,"


Each validator signs the short authenticator to the new version of the resulting database. Validators share their recent set of signed short authenticators with each other, collectively aggregate quorum- signed short authenticators, and also share the recent quorum-signed short authenticators with one another.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
107,49e0568b-53b9-4f9d-b439-c14d0153bd0f,"


Using this collective signature, clients can trust that a database version represents the complete, valid, and irreversible ledger history according to the BFT properties of the protocol. Clients can query any validator (or any third-party replica of the database, such as a full node) to read a database value and verify the result using the authenticator and a proof of the desired data.
7.6.2 Periodic state certification
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
108,0f7dec2a-dbd1-4ebc-9610-3bf685f50147,"


The entirety of the global state accessible by Move can be summarized to a short authenticator at any point in history, similar to a summary of the ledger history. Due to the random access nature of the global state (unlike the ledger history which is append-only), the cost of maintaining this authentication is significant. Nevertheless, when updating the data structure in a large batch, we can compute the update in parallel and also exploit any overlap among the parts that must be updated when each individual state value changes. The Aptos blockchain deliberately only periodically certifies the global state to reduce duplicate shared updates.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
109,7d713727-bd2e-4998-9651-47b9d33acc96,"


During deterministic and configured intervals, the network issues the state checkpoint transactions that include the global state authenticator as part of their output. Such versions are denoted state checkpoints. The larger the gap between two checkpoints, the lower the amortized cost of updating the state authenticated data structure per transaction.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
110,ca184ca6-61a7-433e-a627-db1f5f9191bc,"


With state checkpoints, one can read any state value from them in a trustless way without storing all of the global state. This ability is useful for applications like incremental state syncing, sharded storage across validators, stateless validator nodes, and storage-constrained light clients.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
111,045365bd-9ba6-403b-ba41-5d7588b63772,"


However, because the state checkpoints are periodic, getting a proof to a specific version of the ledger state requires either additional transaction execution for the missing state alternations or an inclusion proof of them from the authenticated ledger history.
State checkpoints are tied to the specific transaction versions in the ledger history, hence bound to the timestamp associated with transaction batches mentioned in Section 7. With the timestamp, a light client can understand the recency of a proven state value. Without a timestamp, a light client proof can only ensure the validity of a previous state that could be far in the past, which provides little assurance of relevance. Also, timestamps for state proofs are necessary for tracking historical access and auditing purposes, such as calculating the average hourly balance of tokens in a token reserve.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
112,3ee38281-590a-4ef1-b662-d22de7f734f7,"


State checkpoints can be derived based on a previous state checkpoint and state alternations in the transaction outputs after it. Hence, persisting state checkpoints to stable storage does not need to be on the critical path for transaction processing. Also, beneficial batching effects exist when persisting the state checkpoints as well. Caching the recent state checkpoints (or rather the delta between them) in memory and dumping only the periodic state checkpoints to stable storage can greatly reduce consumption of storage bandwidth. The way checkpoints are chosen to be persisted does not affect the calculation of the authenticated data structure. Hence, this is a per-node choice: node operators can configure the appropriate trade-off between memory capacity and storage bandwidth.

## 8 State synchronization
The Aptos blockchain aims to provide a high throughput, low latency system for all participants in the ecosystem. As a result, the blockchain must offer an efficient state synchronization protocol to disseminate, verify, and persist blockchain data to light clients, full nodes, and validators [14]. In addition, the synchronization protocol must also be tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity within the network, accounting for different users and use cases. For example, it must allow archival full nodes to verify and persist the entire blockchain history and state, while also enabling light clients to efficiently track only a small subset of the Aptos blockchain state.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
114,eb381bce-e81e-4352-a84d-74cae51241c7,"


To achieve this property, the Aptos blockchain leverages the authenticated ledger history and certified state proofs (see Section 7.6.1) offered by the validators, full nodes, and other replicators to provide a flexible and configurable synchronization protocol. Specifically, participants in the network can select different synchronization strategies to optimize for their use cases and requirements.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
115,dbd58882-f733-45af-b723-1a4c38d10f96,"


For example, in the case of full nodes, Aptos allows multiple synchronization strategies, including the ability to process all transactions since the beginning of time or skip the blockchain history entirely and synchronize only the latest blockchain state using waypoints. In the case of light clients, strategies include synchronizing partial blockchain states, e.g., specific accounts or data values, and enabling
verified state reads, e.g., verified account balance fetching. In all cases, Aptos allows participants to configure the amount and age of the data to fetch, process, and retain.

## 9 Community ownership
The Aptos blockchain will be owned, operated, and governed by a broad and diverse community. A native Aptos token will be used for transaction and network fees, governance voting on protocol upgrades and on-chain/off-chain processes, and securing the blockchain via a proof-of-stake model. A complete description of Aptos token economics will follow in a future publication.

### 9.1 Transaction and network fees
All Aptos transactions have a gas unit price (specified in Aptos tokens) that allows validators to prioritize the highest value transactions in the network. Moreover, at every stage of the pipelined model, there are multiple opportunities to discard low-value transactions (allowing the blockchain to operate efficiently when at system capacity). Over time, network fees will be deployed to ensure that the costs of using the Aptos blockchain are proportionate to the real-world costs of hardware deployment, maintenance, and node operation. Furthermore, developers will have the opportunity to design applications with different cost trade-offs between compute, storage, and networking.

### 9.2 Network governance
Every significant feature change and improvement on the Aptos blockchain will go through several phases, including proposal, implementation, testing, and deployment. This structure creates opportu- nities for relevant parties and stakeholders to provide feedback, share concerns, and offer suggestions. The final phase, deployment, is typically achieved in two steps. First, a software release with the new functionality will be deployed to each node, and second, the functionality will be enabled, e.g., via a feature flag or on-chain configuration variable.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
120,90ab2f6e-ea37-47b4-ac07-e8c58f022d9b,"


Each software deployment by the node operators must be backward compatible, to ensure the new software is interoperable with the supported releases. The process of deploying a new software version may span multiple days, to account for operators in different time zones and any external issues. Once a sufficient number of nodes have been upgraded, the enablement of the new functionality can be triggered by a synchronization point, such as an agreed-on block height or epoch change. In emergency conditions (e.g., when downtime is unavoidable), the enablement can be through a manual and forced change by the node operators, and in the worst cases, a hard fork in the network.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
121,a31f63af-d03b-4caf-83f1-9959934b4597,"


In comparison to other blockchains, the Aptos blockchain encodes its configuration on-chain. Every validator has the ability to synchronize with the current state of the blockchain and automatically select the correct configuration (e.g., consensus protocol and Aptos framework version) based on the current on-chain values. Upgrades in the Aptos blockchain are seamless and instant due to this functionality.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
122,035dd24c-a642-428d-baf4-4f4380e7b3b7,"


To provide flexibility and configurability to the enablement process, the Aptos blockchain will support on-chain governance where token holders can vote with respect to their staked token weights. On-chain voting protocols are public, verifiable, and can be instantaneous. On-chain governance can also support the enablement of non-binary outcomes without software deployment. For example, the on-chain leader election protocol parameters can be modified with on-chain governance whereas a pre- known synchronization point would be unable to handle dynamic modifications since all changes would have to be known ahead of time.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
123,f07d9f73-e0ab-4b02-b4c3-7bb7f1fa92af,"


On-chain governance can, over time, be deployed across the entire upgrade management process. As an example:
1. Token holders vote on-chain about transitioning to a new quantum-resistant signature scheme. 
2. Developers implement and verify the new signature scheme and create a new software release. 
3. Validators upgrade their software to the new release.
4. Token holders vote on-chain to enable the new signature scheme, the on-chain configuration is updated, and the change takes effect.
As an open source project, the Aptos blockchain will depend on strong community feedback and use on-chain governance to manage the appropriate processes. Off-chain upgrade enablement may still be required under certain conditions, but will be minimized over time.

### 9.3 Proof-of-stake consensus
To participate in transaction validation on the Aptos blockchain, validators must have a minimum required amount of staked Aptos tokens. The staked amounts proportionately affect the 2f + 1 stake weighted PoAv during transaction dissemination as well as vote weights and leader selection during block metadata ordering. Validators decide on the split of rewards between themselves and their respective stakers. Stakers can select any number of validators in which to stake their tokens for a pre-agreed reward split. At the end of every epoch, validators and their respective stakers will receive their rewards via the relevant on-chain Move modules.

## 10 Performance
As mentioned in Section 7, the Aptos blockchain is able to achieve optimal throughput and hardware efficiency via its parallel, batch optimized, and modular transaction processing pipeline. Additional performance initiatives, such as consensus upgrades, delta writes, transaction hints, and critical path caching, will continue to increase throughput and improve efficiency over time.

Today, blockchain throughput is typically measured in transactions per second. However, given the wide range of costs and complexity across transactions and infrastructures, this is an imprecise method to compare systems. Transaction latency is also equally flawed as the starting and ending points of submission to finality are varied across experiments.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
126,516741e8-b264-47af-93e3-cd38335e1e38,"


In addition, some systems require apriori knowledge of transaction inputs and outputs and force logical transactions to be split into smaller, less complex transactions. Splitting a transaction results in poor user experiences and artificially impacts latency and throughput, without considering what the developer is trying to accomplish. In contrast, the Aptos approach is to enable developers the freedom to build without limits and to measure throughput and latency with respect to real-world use cases rather than synthetic transactions.

The Aptos blockchain will continue to optimize individual validator performance, as well as exper- iment with scaling techniques that add more validators to the network. Both directions have distinct trade-offs. Any blockchain with parallel execution capabilities can support additional concurrency by requiring more powerful hardware or even structuring each validator as a cluster of individual ma- chines. However, there are practical limits to the number of global validators that is commensurate to the cost and complexity for validator operators. The rise and popularity of serverless databases in cloud services exemplify how few entities can efficiently deploy and maintain these types of complex distributed systems.

### 10.1 Homogeneous state sharding
Initially, the Aptos blockchain will be launched with a single ledger state. Over time, the Aptos network will take a unique approach to horizontal scalability while still maintaining decentralization. This will occur through multiple sharded ledger states, each offering a homogeneous API and sharding as a first-class concept. The Aptos token will be used for transaction fees, staking, and governance on all shards.
","{""file_name"":""aptos-whitepaper.md""}"
129,b1431aaa-a6d6-4040-8053-2206a814328c,"


Data may be transferred between shards through a homogeneous bridge. Users and developers can choose their own sharding schemes depending on their needs. For example, developers can propose a new shard or cluster users within existing shards to achieve high intra-shard connections. More- over, shards may have different system characteristics. One shard might be compute-optimized with SSDs, and another could be optimized for large hard drives with low compute characteristics. By pro- viding hardware flexibility between different shards, developers can leverage the appropriate system characteristics for their applications.

In summary, homogeneous state sharding provides the potential for horizontal throughput scala- bility, allows developers to program with a single universal state across shards, and enables wallets to easily incorporate sharded data for their users. This provides significant performance benefits as well as the simplicity of a single unified Move smart contracts platform.
